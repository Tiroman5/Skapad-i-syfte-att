This has to happen: NASA has to open that cached file that is so enormously big for geneva algorithm through air. Then find the person who has the first position in it (the person who reflected), open him r√•tt by a big payment. Then search for him in the geneva algorithm in that cache. Then put him as "alive" again and not "dead". And then give back his DNA molecules since birth, so the whole World gets their DNA back to normal. And remember; This is the highest reputated persons in the World through the accurate data and will benefit the World if read through. So that is what I Think should happen. Find out paask here all his positions and refresh him into his correct position for overview if he was the best target to be used through raw data and especially source code string. The winning first written in Morse must win and come out too as the 100 percent authentic to human minds. The remaining algorithms written in Morse does not, because they are not 100 percent authentic.
