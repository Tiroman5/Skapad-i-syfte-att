I Think that my texts and material are in VR 4 times and through electronisation, but it should be electronisation and then digitalisation again and again and again. The more times you do it, the better is the quality. And I Think this system applies to my charts too, that are not working as they should [on the police radio at least]. This VR material can be twisted "inside out" too, to more resemble my perspective of it. But you cannot get my perspective of it, because I prove it by that access node to the police radio, that something if that bug is arranged will happen to their radio
